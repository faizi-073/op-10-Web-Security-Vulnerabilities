## 1. Injection Attacks

**Problem:**
Injection attacks, such as SQL injection and command injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as a command or query. This can lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of data.

**Solution:**
Use parameterized queries and prepared statements to ensure that user inputs are treated as data, not executable code.

```java
// Example in Java using PreparedStatement
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(query);
preparedStatement.setString(1, enteredUsername);
preparedStatement.setString(2, enteredPassword);
ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();
```
## 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Problem:
XSS attacks involve injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal sensitive information or perform actions on behalf of the user.

Solution:
Sanitize user inputs and implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to control script execution.

```
<!-- Example CSP Header -->
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://trusted-scripts.com;
```
## Conclusion
Addressing these top 10 web security vulnerabilities is crucial to maintaining a robust defense against potential threats. Regularly updating and auditing your application's security measures, along with staying informed about emerging risks, is key to creating a secure online environment.

**How to Enhance Web Security**
To enhance web security, follow these steps:

**Implement Security Best Practices:**

Regularly update configurations and follow security best practices for web servers, databases, and application frameworks.
Use Security Headers:

Include security headers in your HTTP responses to improve browser security.

```
<!-- Example Content-Security-Policy Header -->
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';
```
